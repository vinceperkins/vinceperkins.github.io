I am a graduate of Purdue University's School of Industrial Engineering and a former Production Control Engineer contractor at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Texas. After completing the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Data Engineering in June 2022, I started a positions as a Data Engineer at Kia America HQ in Irvine, CA. I have a passion for automotive, fintech, and big data. Here you will find posts about my technical hobbies and pursuits. I will share processes, tutorials, and thoughts mostly on the following: 
1. Data engineering
2. Video game design
3. Algorithmic stock trading

As of 2024 I continue to hone my technical skill set and research innovative tech stack solutions that I can apply at work or in my hobbies.
