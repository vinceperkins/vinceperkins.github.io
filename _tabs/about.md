I am a graduate of Purdue University's School of Industrial Engineering and a former Production Control Engineer contractor at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Texas. I have a passion for the automotive industry, big data, and 3D modeling.

You will find posts about my technical hobbies and pursuits. I will share processes, tutorials, and thoughts mostly on the following: 
1. Data engineering
2. Video game design
3. 3D modeling
4. Algorithmic stock trading

Currently I am  transitioning towards a career in data engineering where I want to hone my programming skills and provide value through continuous improvement and workflow automation.
