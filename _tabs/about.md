I am a graduate of Purdue University's School of Industrial Engineering and a former Production Control Engineer contractor at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Texas. I have a passion for the automotive industry, big data, and 3D design. 

Currently I am  transitioning towards a career in data engineering where I want to hone my programming skills and provide value through continuous improvement and workflow automation.
