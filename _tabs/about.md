I am a graduate of Purdue University's School of Industrial Engineering and a former Production Control Engineer contractor at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Texas. I have a passion for the automotive industry, big data, and 3D modeling.

You will find posts about my technical hobbies and pursuits. I will share processes, tutorials, and thoughts mostly on the following: 
1. Data engineering
2. Video game design
3. 3D modeling
4. Algorithmic stock trading

In February 2022 I left my position to work on 3 areas of my life: I wanted to focus on my health, I wanted to focus on my hobbies, and I wanted to obtain a professional certificate in data engineering - a field that have grown more curious about during my time in the work force. Currently I am transitioning towards a career in data engineering where I want to provide value through continuous improvement and workflow automation. As of June 2022 I completed the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Data Engineering to broaden help my technical skill set and now seek a new position as a data engineer.
